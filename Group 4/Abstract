Abstract of the Research

Art and Culture are the least explored topics in the field of Computer Vision and Machine learning research, even so culture represents 
the identity of a certain group of people, on the other hand, art is interchangeably used when describing the culture, art represents the culture 
and culture represents identity. With the emergence of the digital age and modern digital arts, the cultural art style of the Philippines is slowly 
vanishing because of the influence of foreign art styles and new methods of creating arts. In this study, the researchersâ€™ objective is to promote 
the Cultural art style of the Philippines by using modern approaches. Specifically, by using computational and machine learning techniques, 
the researchers used the Neural style transfer method introduced by Gatys et.al. Neural style transfer is based on the VGG-Network model, 
a 19 layered Convolutional Neural Network. In the said development of the model, cultural painting images were gathered as training data and as a target domain.
However Filipino artworks contain unique features and patterns, in that case domain adaptation will be applied. Domain adaptation, 
a transfer learning technique to improve the quality of images that the model produces. By using these techniques, the content image will be blended or 
mixed with the style image which will produce a stylized image as its output. The Neural Style Transfer optimized model will be deployed to an application 
that blends modern or digital images and artworks into Filipino style (art style), with this the researchers' objective can be achieved.
